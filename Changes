	noted had no dates or version numbers attached. This
	changes now.

	Version number for this release is somewhat arbritrary, 
	having been chosen to be larger than the last sort-of
	mentioned vesion number in published papers.

	Code had not been updated for modern C11 compilers.
	A new keyword 'restrict' had been introduced in C,
	so change all variable names of 'restrict' to
	'restricted'. Catch compiler warnings from using fscanf().
